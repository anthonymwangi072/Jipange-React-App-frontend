![image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/88262913/167184972-aa858e33-4fca-4ca0-83c6-7f7d705827ef.png)

This is a frontend application for Bucket list app I created for the end of phase-3 at Flatiron school. 
The focus of this project is building a Sinatra API backend that uses Active Record to access and persist data in a database, which will be used by a separate React frontend that interacts with the database via the API.
  
## Overview 
In this Bucket List app user can keep truck of all everything he/she would like to do in the future: travel to desired places, experience new things, change your lifestyle or habits. 
User can:
* add new items to the list, 
* view items sorted by categories, 
* mark items as complete,
* delete items from the list.

## Requirements
* node version 16.13.0
* npm version 8.5.2
